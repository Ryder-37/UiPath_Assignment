UNIT II
CSS [CASCADING STYLE SHEET]CSS INTRODUCTION
CSS is the language we use to style a Web page..
What is CSS?
o CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
o CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
o CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
o External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
Why Use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for
different devices and screen sizes.
CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a
nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were
added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium {(W3C} created CSS.
CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
CSS Saves a Lot of Work!
The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
How to add CSS
CSS is added to HTML pages to format the document according to information in the style sheet. There
are three ways to insert CSS in HTML documents.
1. Inline CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. External CSS1) Inline €SS: Inline CSS is used to apply CSS on a single line or element.

Example
<p style="color:blug">Hello CSS</p>
2) Internal CSS
Internal CSS is used to apply CSS on a single document or page. It can affect all the elements of the page.
It is written inside the style tag within head section of html.
Example
<style>
p{color:blue}
</style>
3) External CSS
External CSS is used to apply CSS on multiple pages or all pages. Here, we write all the CSS code in a css
file. Its extension must be .css for example style.css.
Example
You need to link style.css file to your html pages like this:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">CSS PROPERTIES AND STYLING
CSS BACKGROUND
CSS background property is used to define the background effects on element. There are 5 CSS
background properties that affects the HTML elements:
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4. background-attachment
5. background-position
1) €SS background-color:
The background-color property is used to specify the background color of the element.
Example:
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>background-color property</title>
<style>
body { text-align:center; background-color: lightblue; }
h1{ color: blue; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello World.</h1>
<h1>Welcome to the javaTpoint.com</h1>
</body>
</html>
2) CSS background-image
The background-image property is used to set an image as a background of an element. By default the
image covers the entire element.
Example
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><style>
body { background-image: url{"paper.gif"); }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This page has an image as the background!</p>
</body>
</html>
3) €SS background-repeat
By default, the background-image property repeats the background image horizontally and vertically.
Some images are repeated only horizontally or vertically.
Example
body { background-image: url("gradient_bg.png"); background-repeat: repeat-x; }
body { background-image: url("gradient_bg.png"); background-repeat: repeat-y; }
PROGRAM
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body { background-image: url{"gradient-bg.png"}; background-repeat: repeat-x;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello Javatpoint.com</h1>
</body>
</html>
4) €SS background-attachment
The background-attachment property is used to specify if the background image is fixed or scroll with
the rest of the page in browser window. If you set fixed the background image then the image will not
move during scrolling in the browser.
Example
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-attachment: fixed;PROGRAM
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body { background: white url('bbb.gif'); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-attachment:
no-repeat; margin-left:200px; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is a fixed background-image. Scroll down the page.</p>

<p>If you do not see any scrollbars, Resize the browser window.</p>
</body>
</html>
5) CSS background-position
The background-position property is used to define the initial position of the background image. By
default, the background image is placed on the top-left of the webpage.
You can set the following positions:
1. center
2. top
3. bottom
4. left
5. rightExample
background-position: center;

</html>CSS CURSOR
It is used to define the type of mouse cursor when the mouse pointer is on the element. It allows us to
specify the cursor type, which will be displayed to the user. When a user hovers on the link, then by

</html>CSS BUTTONS
In HTML, we use the button tag to create a button, but by using CSS properties, we can style the buttons.
Buttons help us to create user interaction and event processing. They are one of the widely used elements
of web pages.
Basic styling in Buttons
* background-color: red;
* border:5px red groove;
* border-radius: 7px;
* box-shadow : 0 8px 16px 0 black, 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19};
* padding: 16px;

</html>CSS FONT
CSS Font property is used to control the look of texts. By the use of CSS font property you can change the
text size, color, style and more.
These are some important font attributes:
1. CSS Font color: This property is used to change the color of the text. (standalone attribute)
2. CSS Font family: This property is used to change the face of the font.
3. CSS Font size: This property is used to increase or decrease the size of the font.
4. CSS Font style: This property is used to make the font bold, italic or oblique.
5. CSS Font variant: This property creates a small-caps effect.
6. CSS Font weight: This property is used to increase or decrease the boldness and lightness of the
font.
1. CSS Font Color
CSS font color is a standalone attribute in CSS although it seems that it is a part of CSS fonts. It is used to
change the color of the text.
There are three different formats to define a color:
* Bya color name
o By hexadecimal value
+ ByRGB
Example
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body { font-size: 100%; }
hi{color:red;}
h2 { color: #9000A1; }
p { color:rgh(0, 220, 98}; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>2. Font Family
In CSS there are five generic font families:
1. Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and
elegance. (Example: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond)
2. Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and
minimalistic look. (Example: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica)
3. Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical
look. (Example: Courier New, Lucida Console, Monaco)
4. Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting. (Example: Brush Script MT, Lucida Handwriting}
5. Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts. (Example: Copperplate, Papyrus)
Example
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body { font-size: 100%; }
h1 { font-family: sans-serif; }
h2 { font-family: serif; }
h3 { font-family: Cursive; }
h4 { font-family: Fantasy; }
p { font-family: monospace; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This heading is shown in sans-serif.</h1>
<h2>This heading is shown in serif.</h2>
<p>This paragraph is written in monospace.</p>
<h3>This heading is shown in sans-serif.</h3>
<h4>This heading is shown in serif.</h4>
</body>
</html>3. CSS Font Size
CSS font size property is used to change the size of the font.
| Font Size Value | Description |
| xx-small | used to display the extremely small text size. |
| x-small | used to display the extra small text size. |

</body>
</html>CSS COLORS
The color property in CSS is used to set the color of HTML elements. Typically, this property is used to set
the background color or the font color of an element.
In CSS, we use color values for specifying the color. We can also use this property for the border-color and
other decorative effects.
We can define the color of an element by using the following ways:
1. RGB format.
2. RGBA format.
3. Hexadecimal notation.
4. HSL.
5. HSLA.
6. Built-in color.
1. RGB Format
RGB format is the short form of 'RED GREEN and BLUE' that is used for defining the color of
an HTML element simply by specifying the values of R, G, B that are in the range of 0 to 255.
The color values in this format are specified by using the rgb() property. This property allows three values
that can either be in percentage or integer (range from 0 to 255).
Example
rgb(238,130,238);
2. RGBA Format
It is almost similar to RGB format except that RGBA contains A (Alpha) that specifies the element's
transparency. The value of alpha is in the range 0.0 to 1.0, in which 0.0 is for fully transparent, and 1.0 is
for not transparent.
Example
rgha(23,67,88,0.5);
3. Hexadecimal notation
Hexadecimal can be defined as a six-digit color representation. This notation starts with the #
symbol followed by six characters ranges from 0 to F. In hexadecimal notation, the first two digits
represent the red {RR} color value, the next two digits represent the green {GG) color value, and the last
two digits represent the blue (BB) color value.The black color notation in hexadecimal is #000000, and the white color notation in hexadecimal is
#FFFFFF. Some of the codes in hexadecimal notation are #FF0000, #00FF00, #0000FF, #FFFF00, and many
more.
Example
color:#EEB2EE;
4. HSL
It is a short form of Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Let's understand them individually.
Hue: It can be defined as the degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 represents red, 120 represents
green, 240 represents blue.
Saturation: It takes value in percentage in which 100% represents fully saturated, i.e., no shades of gray,
50% represent 50% gray, but the color is still visible, and 0% represents fully unsaturated, i.e., completely
gray, and the color is invisible.
Lightness: The lightness of the color can be defined as the light that we want to provide the color in which
0% represents black (there is no light}, 50% represents neither dark nor light, and 100% represents white
(full lightness).
Example
color:hsl{0,50%,50%);
I ut 30°
0% SATURATION 100%
0% LIGHTNESS / BRIGHTNESS 100%5. HSLA
It is entirely similar to HSL property, except that it contains A (alpha) that specifies the element's
transparency. The value of alpha is in the range 06.0 to 1.6, in which 0.0 indicates fully transparent,
and 1.0 indicates not transparent.
Example
color:hsla(0,50%,50%,0.5);
Hue:
— ee Qi 3
Saturation:
4 o— 3
Lightness:
Co oO
Alpha:
To oT a ~© | hela(180, 50%, 50%, 100%) |
Built-in Colors
| S.no. | Color name | Hexadecimal Value | Decimal Value or rgh() value |
| 1 | Red | #FFO000 | rgh(255,0,0) |
| 2. | Orange | H#FFAS00 | rgh(255,165,0) |
| 3. | Yellow | H#FFFFO0 | rgh(255,255,0) |
| a | Pink | #FFCOCB | rgb(255,192,203) |
| 5. | Green | #008000 | rgb(0,128,0) |
| 6. | Violet | #EES2EE | rgh{238,130,238} |
| 7. | Blue | #0000FF | 1gb(0,0,255) |
| 3. | Aqua | HOOFEFF | rgb(0,255,255) |
| 9. | Brown | #AS2A2A | rgb(165,42,42) |
| 10. | White | HFEFEFE | rgb(255,255,255) |
| 11. | Gray | #808080 | rgb(128,128,128) |
| 12. | Black | #000000 | 1gb(0,0,0) |Example

The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element. In simple word, you can say
that it specifies the clarity of the image.
opacity opacity opacity opacity opacity

How to apply CSS opacity setting
Opacity setting is applied uniformly across the entire object and the opacity value is defined in term of
digital value less than 1. The lesser opacity value displays the greater opacity. Opacity is not inherited.

</html>CSS id & class - [SELECTORS]
The selectors in CSS are part of the CSS ruleset and used to select the content we want to style. Id and
class both are the CSS element selectors and are used to identify an element based on its assigned name.
CSS id and class selectors are the most used selectors in CSS.
During the use of selectors, sometimes there is confusion occurs between id and class. Both of them do
not have any default styling information; they require CSS to select them and apply it to style. Although
both are used for selecting the element, they are different from each other in many ways.
The difference between the id and class is tabulated as follows.
| Class | Id |
We can apply a class to various elements so that it The Id is unique in a page, and we can only

The class is assigned to an element and its name starts | The name of the Id starts with the "#"

element.
Syntax: Syntax:
.class{ #id{
// declarations of CSS // declarations of CSS
} }
ID Selector
The id selector is used to select the id attribute of an HTML element for selecting a particular element. An
id is always unique within the page, so it is chosen to select a single, unique element.
It is written with the hash character (#), followed by the id of the element.
The example of the id selector is given as follows.
Example
In this example, we are selecting the element with the id "para".
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#para { text-align: center; color: blue; font-size: 25px; background-color: pink; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1> Welcome to the Javatpoint.com </h1><p id = "para">This paragraph will be affected.</p>
<p>This paragraph will not be affected.</p>
</body>
</html>
Class Selector
The class selector is used to select the HTML elements with a specific class attribute. It is written with a
period character. {Full stop symbol) followed by the class name. A class name should not be started with
a number.
Example
In this example, we are selecting the elements with the class "example".
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
example { text-align: center; color: blue; font-size: 25px; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="example">This heading is blue and center-aligned.</h1>
<p class="example">This paragraph is blue and center-aligned.</p>
</body>
</html>
CSS Class Selector for a specific element
We can also style the specific element using the class selector, no matter if it is applied to different
elements.
If we need to specify that only one specific HTML element should be affected, we must use the element
name with the class selector.
It will be clear from the following example.
Example
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p.example { text-align: center; color: blue; font-size: 25px; }</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="example">This heading is not effected.</h1>
<p class="example">This paragraph is blue and center-aligned.</p>
</body>
</html>
There is another example in which we apply multiple classes on the same element. Let's see an illustration
of the same.
Example
In this example, we are using two classes {example and para) on the paragraph element and styling the
paragraph using both classes.
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.example { text-align: center; color: red; font-size: 1cm; }
.para{ font-family: Lucida Calligraphy; text-shadow: 5px 8px 9px yellow; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="example">This heading is red and center-aligned.</h1>
<p class="example para">This paragraph is red and center-aligned with a font-family "Lucida
Calligraphy" and text-shadow.</p>
</body>
</html>CSS Box Model
The components that can be depicted on the web page consist of one or more than one rectangular box.
A CSS box model is a compartment that includes numerous assets, such as edge, border, padding and
material. It is used to develop the design and structure of a web page. It can be used as a set of tools to
personalize the layout of different components. According to the CSS box model, the web browser
supplies each element as a square prism.
The following diagram illustrates how the CSS properties of width, height, padding, border and margin
dictate that how much space an attribute will occupy on a web page.

The CSS box model contains the different properties in CSS. These are listed below.
Border - It is a region between the padding-box and the margin. Its proportions are determined by the
width and height of the boundary.
Margin - This segment consists of the area between the boundary and the edge of the border. The
proportion of the margin region is equal to the margin-box width and height. It is better to separate the
product from its neighbor nodes.
Padding - This field requires the padding of the component. In essence, this area is the space around the
subject area and inside the border-box. The height and the width of the padding box decide its
proportions.Content - Material such as text, photographs, or other digital media is included in this area. It is
constrained by the information edge, and its proportions are dictated by the width and height of the
content enclosure.
ELEMENTS OF THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT
Typically, when you assign the width and height of an attribute using the CSS width and height assets, it
means you just positioned the height and width of the subject areas of that component. The additional
height and width of the unit box is based on a range of influences.
The specific area that an element box may occupy on a web page is measured as follows-
| Size of the | Properties of CSS |
box
| Height | height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom + margin-top + |
margin-bottom
| Width | width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right + margin-left + margin- |

</html>CSS Navigation bar
A Navigation bar or navigation system comes under GUI that helps the visitors in accessing information.
It is the Ul element on a webpage that includes links for the other sections of the website.
A navigation bar is mostly displayed on the top of the page in the form of a horizontal list of links. It can
be placed below the logo or the header, but it should always be placed before the main content of the
webpage.
It is important for a website to have easy-to-use navigation. It plays an important role in the website as it
allows the visitors to visit any section quickly.
1. Horizontal Navigation Bar
The horizontal navigation bar is the horizontal list of links, which is generally on the top of the page.
Let's see how to create a horizontal navigation bar by using an example.
Example
In this example, we are adding the overflow: hidden property that prevents the li elements from going
outside of the list, display: block property displays the links as the block elements and makes the entire
link area clickable.
We are also adding the float: left property, which uses float for getting the block elements to slide them
next to each other.
If we want the full-width background color then we have to add the background-color property
to <ul> rather than the <a> element.
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
ul { list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: Opx; overflow: hidden; background-color:
lightgray; }
li { float: left; }
li a { display: block; color: blue; font-size:20px; text-align: center; padding: 10px 20px;
text-decoration: none; }
.active { background-color: gray; color: white; }
Ii a:hover { background-color: orange; color: white; }
<[style>
</head>
<body>
<ul>
<li><a class="active" href="#home">Home</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Java</a></li><li><a href="#">HTML</a></li>
<li><a href="#">CSS</a></li>
<ful>
</body>
</html>
2. Vertical Navigation Bar
In this example, we are going to see how to build a vertical navigation bar.
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
ul { list-style-type: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; width: 200px; background-color: lightblue;
border: 1px solid blue; }
li a { display: block; color: blue; font-size:20px; padding: 10px 20px; text-decoration: none;
border-bottom: 1px solid blue; }
ul:last-child { border-bottom: none; }
.active{ background-color: orange; color: white; }
li a:hover { background-color: orange; color: white; }
<[style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Vertical Navigation Bar</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#" class = "active">Home</a></li>
<li><a href = "#">Java</a></li>
<li><a href = "#">CSS</a></li>
<li><a href = "#">HTML</a></li>
<li><a href = "#">Bootstrap</a></li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>CSS MARGIN
CSS Margin property is used to define the space around elements. It is completely transparent and doesn't
have any background color. It clears an area around the element.
Top, bottom, left and right margin can be changed independently using separate properties. You can also
change all properties at once by using shorthand margin property.
There are following CSS margin properties:
CSS Margin Properties
| Property | Description |
| margin | This property is used to set all the properties in one declaration. |
| margin-left | itis used to set left margin of an element. |
| margin-right | It is used to set right margin of an element. |
| margin-top | It is used to set top margin of an element. |
| margin-bottom | It is used to set bottom margin of an element. |
CSS Margin Values
These are some possible values for margin property.
| Value | Description |
| auto | This is used to let the browser calculate a margin. |
| length | It is used to specify a margin pt, px, cm, etc. its default value is Opx. |
| % | It is used to define a margin in percent of the width of containing element. |
| inherit | It is used to inherit margin from parent element. |
Note: You can also use negative values to overlap content.
Example
You can define different margin for different sides for an element.
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p { background-color: pink; }
p.ex { margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px; margin-right: 100px; margin-left: 100px; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>This paragraph is not displayed with specified margin. </p>
<p class="ex">This paragraph is displayed with specified margin.</p>
</body>
</html>CSS BORDER
The CSS border is a shorthand property used to set the border on an element.
The CSS border properties are use to specify the style, color and size of the border of an element. The CSS
border properties are given below
1. border-style
2. border-color
3. border-width
4. border-radius
5. border-collapse
6. border-spacing property
1. CSS border-style
The Border style property is used to specify the border type which you want to display on the web page.
Example
p {border-style: none;}
p {border-style: dotted;}
p {border-style: dashed;}
p {border-style: solid;}
p {border-style: double;}
p {border-style: groove;}
p {border-style: ridge;}
p {border-style: inset;}
p {border-style: outset;}
p {border-style: hidden;}
PROGRAM
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p.one { border-style: solid; border-color: red; }
p.two { border-style: solid; border-color: #98bf21; }</style>
</head>
<body>
<p class="one">This is a solid red border</p>
<p class="two">This is a solid green border</p>
</body>
</html>
2. CSS border-width
The border-width property is used to set the border's width. It is set in pixels. You can also use the one of
the three pre-defined values, thin, medium or thick to set the width of the border. The border-width
property is not used alone. It is always used with other border properties like "border-style" property to
set the border first otherwise it will not work.
Example
border-width: Spx;
3. CSS border-color
There are three methods to set the color of the border.
* Name: It specifies the color name. For example: "red".
* RGB: It specifies the RGB value of the color. For example: "rgh(255,0,0)".
* Hex: lt specifies the hex value of the color. For example: "#ff0000".
There is also a border color named "transparent™. If the border color is not set it is inherited from the
color property of the element. The border-color property is not used alone. It is always used with other
border properties like "border-style" property to set the border first otherwise it will not work.
Example
border-color: red;
border-color: #98bf21;
border-color: rgh({255,0,0}
4. CSS border-radius property
This CSS property sets the rounded borders and provides the rounded corners around an element, tags,
or div. lt defines the radius of the corners of an element.Itis shorthand for border top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-right-radius and border-
bottom-left-radius. It gives the rounded shape to the corners of the border of an element. We can specify
the border for all four corners of the box in a single declaration using the border-radius. The values of this
property can be defined in percentage or length units.
| Property | Description |
| border-top-left-radius | It is used to set the border-radius for the top-left corner |
| border-top-right-radius | It is used to set the border-radius for the top-right corner |
| border-bottom-right-radius | It is used to set the border-radius for the bottom-right corner |
| border-bottom-left-radius | It is used to set the border-radius for the bottom-left corner |
If the bottom-left value is omitted, then it will be same as the top-right. If the value of bottom-right is
eliminated, then it will be same as the top-left. Similarly, if top-right is eliminated, then it will be the same
as top-left.
Let's see what happens when we provide a single value, two values, three values, and four values to this
property.
* If we provide a single value (such as border-radius: 30px;} to this property, it will set all corners to
the same value.
* When we specify two values (such as border-radius: 20% 10% ;}, then the first value will be used
for the top-left and bottom-right corners, and the second value will be used for the top-right and
bottom-left corners.
* When we use three values (such as border-radius: 10% 30% 20%;) then the first value will be used
for the top-left corner, the second value will be applied on top-right, and bottom-left corners and
the third value will be applied to the bottom-right corner.
* Similarly, when this property has four values {border-radius: 10% 30% 20% 40%;) then the first
value will be the radius of top-left, the second value will be used for the top-right, the third value
will be applied on bottom-right, and the fourth value is used for bottom-left.
Example
border-radius: 25% 10%;
5. Border Collapse
This value is used to collapse the borders into a single border. Using this, two adjacent table cells will share
a border.
Example
border-collapse: collapse;
PROGRAM
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html><head>
<title> border-collapse property </title>
<style>
table{ border: 2px solid blue; text-align: center; font-size: 20px; width: 80%; height: 50%; }
th{ border: Spx solid red; background-color: yellow; }
td{ border: Spx solid violet; background-color: cyan; }
#t1{ border-collapse: collapse; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1> The border-collapse Property </h1>
<h2> border-collapse: collapse; </h2>
<table id = "t1">
<tr> <th> First_Name </th> <th> Last_Name </th> <th> Subject </th> <th> Marks </th> </tr>
<tr> <td> James </td> <td> Gosling </td> <td> Maths </td> <td> 92 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Alan </td> <td> Rickman </td> <td> Maths </td> <td> 89 </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Sam </td> <td> Mendes </td> <td> Maths </td> <td> 82 </td> </tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
6. border-spacing property
This CSS property is used to set the distance between the borders of the adjacent cells in the table. It
applies only when the border-collapse property is set to separate. There will not be any space between
the borders if the border-collapse is set to collapse.
It can be defined as one or two values for determining the vertical and horizontal spacing.
* When only one value is specified, then it sets both horizontal and vertical spacing.
* When we use the two-value syntax, then the first one is used to set the horizontal spacing {i.e.,
the space between the adjacent columns), and the second value sets the vertical spacing (i.e., the
space between the adjacent rows).
Example
border-spacing: 45px;
border-spacing: 45px 20px;
PROGRAM
<IDOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title> border-spacing property </title>
<style>

</html>CSS Padding
CSS Padding property is used to define the space between the element content and the element border.
Itis different from CSS margin in the way that CSS margin defines the space around elements. CSS padding
is affected by the background colors. It clears an area around the content.
Top, bottom, left and right padding can be changed independently using separate properties. You can also
change all properties at once by using shorthand padding property.
CSS Padding Properties
| Property | Description |
| padding | It is used to set all the padding properties in one declaration. |
| padding-left | It is used to set left padding of an element. |
| padding-right | It is used to set right padding of an element. |
| padding-top | It is used to set top padding of an element. |
| padding-bottom | It is used to set bottom padding of an element. |
CSS Padding Values
| Value | Description |
| length | It is used to define fixed padding in pt, px, em etc. |
| % | It defines padding in % of containing element. |
