UNIT 1 BLOCKCHAIN
Distributed DBMS - Limitations of Distributed DBMS:
» Complexity: Distributed database systems are inherently more complex than
centralized systems, making them more challenging to design, implement, and
maintain.
» Data Inconsistency: Maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes in a
distributed system is a significant challenge, as data updates need to be
propagated to all nodes in a timely and reliable manner.
» Performance: Distributed systems can experience performance issues due to
network latency, increased communication overhead, and the need for data
replication and synchronization.
» Security: With data distributed across multiple locations, ensuring data security
and access control becomes more challenging, as potential vulnerabilities and
attack vectors increase.
» Cost: Implementing a distributed database system often requires additional
hardware, software, and network infrastructure, leading to higher overall costs.
» Fault Tolerance: Distributed systems must be designed to handle node failures,
network partitions, and other potential issues, which can be complex and
resource-intensive.
» Data Integration: Integrating data from multiple heterogeneous sources in a
distributed environment can be a significant challenge, requiring standardization
and data transformation processes.Introduction to Blockchain:
History:
1. The concept of blockchain was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous person or group
known as Satoshi Nakamoto in the Bitcoin white paper.
2. Bitcoin, the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, was launched in 2009 and served
as the initial practical implementation of blockchain technology.
3. Over time, the potential of blockchain technology for applications beyond
cryptocurrencies was recognized, leading to its adoption in various industries.
Definition:
1. Ablockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that records transactions
across multiple computers or nodes in a network.
2. ltis essentially a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked
and secured using cryptography.
3. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and
transaction data, forming an immutable and tamper-evident chain.
Distributed Ledger:
1. Adistributed ledger is a database that is spread across multiple locations or nodes in
a decentralized network.
2. lt allows for transparent and secure record-keeping without the need for a central
authority or intermediary.
3. Participants in the network can access, verify, and update the ledger through a
consensus mechanism.Blockchain Categories:
» Public Blockchain:
» Public blockchains are open and permissionless, allowing anyone to join the
network, participate in the consensus process, and access the full transaction
history.
» Examples: Bitcoin, Ethereum.
» Private Blockchain:
» Private blockchains are permissioned and controlled by a single organization or
entity.
» Access to the network and the ability to participate in the consensus process are
restricted.
» Private blockchains offer enhanced privacy and control but sacrifice the
decentralized nature of public blockchains.
» Consortium Blockchain:
» Consortium blockechains are semi-decentralized and governed by a group of
organizations or entities.
» The consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes or validators.
» Consortium blockchains strike a balance between decentralization and control,
often used in enterprise or industry-specific applications.
» Blockchain Network and Nodes:
» Ablockchain network consists of multiple nodes {computers or devices)
connected to each other in a peer-to-peer fashion.
» Each node participates in the validation and consensus process by verifying and
adding new blocks to the chain.
» Nodes can be classified as full nodes {maintaining the entire blockchain) or light
nodes {maintaining a subset of the blockchain).
» Peer-to-Peer Network:» Blockchain networks operate on a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, where nodes
communicate directly with each other without a central server or intermediary.
» This decentralized architecture enhances resilience, as the network can
continue functioning even if some nodes fail or leave the network.
» Peer-to-peer networks enable the propagation of transactions and blocks across
the network in a distributed manner.
Mining Mechanism:
» Mining is the process of validating and adding new transactions to the
blockchain by solving complex cryptographic puzzles.
» Miners {specialized nodes) compete to solve these puzzles using computational
power, and the first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the chain
and earn a reward.
» Mining serves two main purposes: validating transactions and introducing new
cryptocurrency units into circulation.
» The mining process is designed to be resource-intensive and competitive,
ensuring the security and integrity of the blockchain.
Generic Elements of Blockchain:
» Distributed Ledger: A decentralized database that records transactions across
multiple nodes.
» Cryptography: The use of cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and
ensure data integrity.
» Consensus Mechanism: A set of rules and algorithms used to achieve
agreement among nodes on the state of the blockchain.
» Decentralization: The absence of a central authority or intermediary, enabling
direct peer-to-peer interactions.
» [Immutability: Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it becomes virtually
impossible to alter or tamper with it.
» Transparency: The ability for all participants to view and verify the transactions
recorded on the blockchain.Features of Blockchain:
» Decentralization: No central authority or intermediary is required, enabling direct
peer-to-peer transactions.
» Transparency: All transactions are visible to all participants, ensuring
transparency and auditability.
» [Immutability: Once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or
deleted, providing tamper-resistance.
» Security: Blockchain leverages cryptographic techniques to secure transactions
and maintain data integrity.
» Consensus: The network nodes follow a consensus mechanism to agree on the
state of the blockchain, ensuring consistency.
» Traceability: Each transaction is traceable and can be tracked across the entire
blockchain, providing a clear audit trail.
Types of Blockchain:
» Public Blockchains: Open and permissionless networks where anyone can
participate in the consensus process and access the full transaction history
{e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
» Private Blockchains: Controlled and permissioned networks where access and
participation are restricted to a specific organization or group {e.g., enterprise
blockchains).
» Consortium Blockchains: Semi-decentralized networks governed by a group of
organizations or entities, often used in industry-specific applications.
» Permissioned Blockchains: Blockchains where participants are vetted and
granted specific privileges or roles, offering more control and privacy.
» Permissionless Blockchains: Open and decentralized blockchains where anyone
can join and participate without prior authorization.
» Hybrid Blockchains: Combining elements of public and private blockchains,
enabling selective data sharing and controlled access.
