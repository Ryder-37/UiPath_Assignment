Blockehain Architecture:
» Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, and immutable digital ledger.
» [t consists of a chain of blocks, where each block contains a set of transactions.
» Blocks are linked together using cryptographic hashes, forming an unalterable
chain.
» The first block in the chain is called the genesis block.
» Transactions are verified and validated by a network of nodes before being added
to a block.
» Each node maintains a copy of the entire blockchain, ensuring transparency and
redundancy.
» Blockchain architecture is designed to be resilient, secure, and resistant to data
tampering.
» [teliminates the need for a central authority or intermediary by enabling peer-to-
peer transactions.
» Smart contracts can be deployed on the blockchain, enabling programmable
and self-executing agreements.
» Blockchain architecture can be permissionless (public) or permissioned
{private/consortium), depending on the access control mechanisms.
2. Operation of Bitcoin Blockchain:
» Bitcoin was the first and most well-known implementation of blockchain
technology.
» [toperates on a decentralized peer-to-peer network with no central authority.
» Users can send and receive Bitcoin transactions using digital wallets and
addresses.
» Transactions are broadcast to the network and validated by miners.
» Miners compete to solve a computationally intensive cryptographic puzzle
{Proof-of-Work) to add new blocks to the chain.
» The first miner to solve the puzzle and broadcast the new block receives a reward
in the form of newly minted bitcoins.
» The Bitcoin blockchain is designed to maintain a target block time of
approximately 10 minutes.
» The difficulty of the cryptographic puzzle adjusts automatically to maintain a
consistent block time.» Bitcoin uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model to track and manage
transactions.
» The Bitcoin blockchain is transparent, and all transactions are publicly visible
and verifiable.
3. Consensus Mechanisms:
a. Proof of Work (PoW):
» PoW is the consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin and several other
blockchains.
» Miners compete to solve a computationally intensive cryptographic puzzle to
add new blocks.
» The puzzle involves finding a nonce value that produces a hash meeting specific
difficulty criteria.
» The first miner to solve the puzzle and broadcast the new block is rewarded with
newly minted coins.
» PoW ensures that blocks are added to the chain in a secure and decentralized
manner.
» [t provides security through the computational effort required to solve the puzzle.
» PoW is energy-intensive and has scalability limitations due to its computational
requirements.
» [tincentivizes miners to contribute computing power to secure the network.
» PoW is resistant to Sybil attacks and ensures a fair distribution of mining
rewards.
» Alternative PoW algorithms, such as Equihash and Ethash, have been developed
to address ASIC centralization concerns.
b. Proof of Stake (PoS):
» PoSis an alternative consensus mechanism that aims to address the energy
consumption and scalability issues of PoW.
» Instead of computational power, PoS relies on the stake {cryptocurrency
holdings} of validators.
» Validators are selected to validate and add new blocks based on their stake in
the network.
» The selection process can be based on various algorithms, such as coin age,
randomized selection, or a combination of factors.» Validators are incentivized to act honestly and validate transactions correctly to
earn rewards and avoid penalties.
» vi. PoS is more energy-efficient than PoW since it does not require intensive
computational work.
» vii. lt provides better scalability and faster transaction confirmation times.
» viii. PoS systems can suffer from the "nothing at stake” problem, where
validators have no incentive to behave honestly.
» ix. Various PoS algorithms, such as Delegated PoS (DPoS), Leased PoS {LPoS),
and Casper (Ethereum’s PoS implementation), have been developed to address
different challenges.
» Xx. PoS requires careful design and incentive mechanisms to ensure security and
decentralization.
c. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):
» BFTis a consensus mechanism designed to achieve agreement in distributed
systems with potentially malicious nodes.
» [tensures that the system can reach consensus and continue operating
correctly, even if some nodes fail or act maliciously.
» BFT systems typically involve a set of validators or replicas that participate in the
Consensus process.
» The consensus algorithm must handle scenarios where up to one-third of the
validators are faulty or malicious.
» BFT systems can provide higher transaction throughput and lower latency
compared to PoW and PoS.
» They are often used in permissioned blockchain networks or consortium
environments.
» BFT consensus algorithms, such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
and Tendermint, have been developed and implemented in various blockchain
systems.
» BFT systems require careful parameter tuning and configuration to ensure
optimal performance and security.
» They may have scalability limitations due to the communication overhead
involved in reaching consensus among validators.
» BFT systems are typically more complex and require a higher level of
coordination compared to other consensus mechanisms.d. Proof of Authority (PoA}):
» PoAis a consensus mechanism used in permissioned blockchain networks.
» [trelies on a set of pre-approved and trusted validators (authorities) to validate
transactions and add new blocks.
» Authorities are typically identified by their real-world identities and reputations.
» PoA systems can achieve higher throughput and lower latency compared to PoW
and PoS.
» They are suitable for consortium or enterprise-level blockchain networks with
known and trusted participants.
» PoA systems are more centralized than public blockchains but can provide
better performance and efficiency.
» Authorities are incentivized to behave honestly to maintain their reputation and
continue participating in the network.
» PoA systems can be vulnerable to collusion or compromised authorities, as they
rely on trusted entities.
» Careful selection and monitoring of authorities are crucial to maintain the
integrity and security of the network.
» PoAis often used in combination with other consensus mechanisms, such as
BFT, for added security and fault tolerance.
e. Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET):
» PoETis a consensus mechanism developed by Intel for permissioned blockchain
networks.
» [tuses a trusted execution environment (TEE) to ensure the integrity and
randomness of the leader election process.
» The leader election is based on a random wait time, with the node waiting the
shortest time being elected as the leader.
» PoET aims to provide a fair and energy-efficient consensus mechanism without
the need for intensive computational work.
» [tis designed to be secure against various attacks, such as grinding or pre-
computing attacks.
» PoET requires specialized hardware {Intel SGX) to implement the trusted
execution environment.
» [tis suitable for permissioned and consortium blockchain networks with known
participants.
» viii. PoET can provide high transaction throughput and low latency compared to
other consensus mechanisms.
» ix. It eliminates the need for energy-intensive mining or staking processes.» x. PoET is still a relatively new consensus mechanism and is primarily used in
Intel-based blockchain solutions.
